## How Bamazon Works

  * `BamazonCustomer.js`

      * Prints the products in the store.

      * Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase.

      * Asks for the quantity.

        * If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, Bamazon will return the total for that purchase.
        * However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, Bamazon will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
        * If the purchase goes through, the program will update the stock quantity.
        * Bamazon will also update the product sales in the department table.
